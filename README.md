# Kevin's Word Guessing Game
This app simply allows users to guess any five letter word.  I have linked my JavaScript to an API that generates a five letter word of the day. The user of the app is able to submit any five letter word the JavaScript then checks the letters of the guessed word against the API. If each letter returns correct then the user is notified that there word is correct. I realize this is not the most user friendly app, and I intend to come back to this project in order to include more user friendly functions within the app, like checking and returning each correct letter rather than simply notifying the user if the entire word is correct. At this time it's very unlikely a user guesses the correct five letter word, because there is not much feedback with each guess.
